/**
 *  Architecture Blueprint
 *
 *  Additional architectures need to build of this class.
 *  This Architecture gets a lot of it's logic through the constructor. To get the Processor in another State this architecture contains the main execution and syntax events.
 *  While the compilation process is fully integrated if the Syntax Logic is given through an abstracted Grammar and Assembly Class. The Execution Process needs to be implemented in the events.
 *  To make Debugging simpler i would recommend to implement a binary mapper which maps a certain instruction with it's parameters to a binary representation and the other way around.
 *  I would recommend you to look at integration of RV32I Assembler, Grammar and Binary Mapper as an example.
 *
 *  @param config Specific config "file" which should be defined in an object which contains all configuration constants of the architecture.
 *  @param asmConfig Specific Grammar and Assembler class which is then given the Architecture through the asmConfig "file"
 *
 *  Essential Features
 *  @property description Essential: Given by Config
 *  @property regContainer Essential: Given by Config
 *  @property memory Essential: Given by Config
 *
 *  @property console Instantiated with Config name
 *  @property assembler Instantiated with AsmConfig grammar and assembly and ArchConst COMPILER_REGEX and StandardHL
 *
 *  @property features Holds specific Assembler features.
 *  @property settings Holds specific Architecture Setup settings.
 *
 *  Possible Features
 *  @property cache Not Essential: Possibly given by Config
